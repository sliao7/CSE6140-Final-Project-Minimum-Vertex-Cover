## Branch-and-Bound 
* Used a 2-Approximation Algorithm to find the lower bound quickly
* Applied Binary Decision Tree to loop through all possible vertex covers
* Used a priority queue to find the most promising decision node to branch based on the degree of vertex in the remaining graph and the lowerbound of decision node

* Note: can also apply Linear Programming relaxation to find a lower bound. See related [ Math Notes](http://theory.stanford.edu/~trevisan/cs261/lecture07.pdf) and [ Python Code](https://realpython.com/linear-programming-python/)
